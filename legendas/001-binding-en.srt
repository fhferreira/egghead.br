JOHN LINDQUIST: Let's talk about binding an AngularJS.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We'll just set up a div with a NG app attribute.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Basically, this attribute says that this element and anything

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
inside of it belongs to this app.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We'll go into that more later.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
But for now, binding looks something like this.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So we'll have a data message inside of those tags.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We don't have anything to bind to it yet.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
But I just want to show that you can really evaluate any

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
sort of expression in here.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Let's make this a bit bigger.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So 2 plus 2, if I hit refresh, that'll evaluate to 4.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
3 plus 2, hit refresh, that'll evaluate to 5.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And you can do things like John plus Lindquist, evaluate.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And again, any sort of--

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
not any sort of expression, but many expressions can be

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
evaluated in here.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Now there's a lot of things that you shouldn't do in here.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
You should really keep this logic to a minimum, because

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
this is your view in presentation.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
But there's really quite a lot of things you can do in there.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Basically, where this gets really useful is when you

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
create an input or any way for the user to interact with the

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
site or your app.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And you give it a model, say, data message.

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And then here we'll say, data message.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So when I refresh in here, because I have a model bound

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
to that, I can just start typing and it magically

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
updates at every key press.

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So that's how your data is being bound to and being

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
presented to however that model changes.

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Now this can also do things like--

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
so if we just do plus world, for a proper hello world.

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
We can type hello, and it'll show hello world.

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Now where this can get a bit crazy and

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
cool, you can actually--

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
if I say div and give this a class of that data message,

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
which is kind of a weird name for it, but we'll just leave

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,000
it for now, and say, wrap me with a foundation component.

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So these foundation components are inside

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
the foundation library.

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So a panel, an alert box, a label.

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You can see that this is updating what's actually

45
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
inside of this attribute, that value in there.

46
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
So you can really manipulate a lot of the dom

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
using the data binding.

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's not just presenting simple text or anything, but

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
there's a lot more complex things you can do.

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So that's data binding in a nutshell, and we'll
