00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000


2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now that we've gone through binding a bit, let's talk

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
about controllers.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So let's take this data from this ng-model and kind of

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
extract it out into a controller which will provide

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
the data for us.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So we'll take this entire code block here and we'll wrap it

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
in a div, and to ng-controller, and we'll just

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
call this our FirstCtrl.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Now you can see that everything inside this div is

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
going to have the scope of that controller.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So let's go ahead and delete that ng-model data.message, so

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:51,000
we have nothing providing that data message to our bound

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
expression.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So if we set up our script, we'll just say main.js is a

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
file and create it.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And let's define something called first controller.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
FirstCtrl.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And from here, what happens is you pass in the $scope, and

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
that $scope is again related to these elements and

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
everything contained inside of there.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's kind of the scope of what can go on in this controller.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And inside that $scope we'll create a model, which we've

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
just called data so far.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And we'll say the message is hello.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So if we refresh, we can see we're now using the same

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
data.message, but now we're getting the hello from the

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
controller in here.

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So if we did the panel again and we refresh from there, you

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
can see we create the panel.

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
But now the data's being provided from

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
a JavaScript file.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So you can write to your behaviors and everything

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
inside of here instead of just trying to relate everything to

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
some sort of user input.

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So in your controller you can use the service calls or other

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
things to get data to push into your view.

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So that's the basics of a controller and
